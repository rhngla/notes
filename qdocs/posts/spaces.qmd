We'll start with some definitions - the goal is to situate ourselves with:
 
 - `objects` we'll work with, 
 - `spaces` they live in
 - `rules` that govern relationships and operations between them.
 
 Ultimately we want to construct analysis tools i.e. operations to manipulate such objects constructed from data, and discover relationships without violating definitions and underlying assumptions (or at least doing so knowingly). Further, through these definitions we notice somewhat hierarchical relationships of such objects, spaces, and rules. Some definitions are more abstract, and some are special cases with additional rules. Being aware of where in the abstraction hierarchy we operate is helpful to manage complexity while analyzing data.

# Fundamentals

## Metric and metric space {#sec-metricspace}

A distance metric $d$ is defined on set $M$
 $$
 d:M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
 $$

A distance metric is sometimes called just "distance" or just "metric". For all $x,y,z \in M$ the following relationships hold for any valid distance metric:
$$
\begin{aligned}
d(x, y) &\geq 0 \\
d(x, y) &=0 \Longleftrightarrow x=y \\
d(x, y) &=d(y, x) \\
d(x, z) &\leq d(x, y)+d(y, z)
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-metric}

A metric space is defined as the ordered pair $(M,d)$, where $M$ is a set, and $d$ is a distance metric. Reference to the metric $d$ is occasionally omitted understood from the context, and the metric space is denoted simply by $(M)$.

Cosine distance, defined for vectors $x$ and $y$ in Euclidean space as $1-\cos\theta$ where $\theta = \frac{x \cdot y}{\|x\| \|y\|}$, is not a distance metric in general (e.g. $d(x, 2x) = 0$, but $x\neq 2x$). However, it becomes a valid distance metric if we restrict our set of vectors to only those that have a fixed norm ($\| x \| = c$).

## Field {#sec-field}

A field is a set $F$ which includes $0$ and $1$ and binary operations of addition $+$ and multiplication $\cdot$ such that for all elements $x,y,z \in F$ the following hold:

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 + x &= x \\
x + (-x) &= 0, \quad -x \in F \\
x + y &= y + x \\
x + (y + z) &= (x + y) + z \\
1 \cdot x &= 1 \\
x^{-1} \cdot x &= 1, \quad \forall x \neq 0 \\
x \cdot y &= y \cdot x \\
x \cdot (y \cdot z) &= (x \cdot y) \cdot z \\
x \cdot (y + z) &= (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z) \\
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-vectorspace}

We typically deal with the real field $\mathbb{R}$ or complex field $\mathbb{C}$

## Vector space {#sec-vectorspace}

A vector space over a field $F$ is a set $V$ together with operations of addition and scalar multiplication such that for all vectors $x,y,z \in V$ and all scalars $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{F}$ the following hold:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x + y &= y + x \\
(x + y) + z &= x + (y + z) \\
x + 0 &= x \\
x + (-x) &= 0 \\
\alpha (x + y) &= \alpha x + \alpha y \\
(\alpha + \beta) x &= \alpha x + \beta x \\
\alpha (\beta x) &= (\alpha \beta) x \\
1x &= x
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-vectorspace}

## Norm {#sec-norm}

A norm on a vector space $V$ is a function $w:V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies:
$$
\begin{aligned}
w(x) &\geq 0 \\
w(x) &= 0 \implies x = 0 \\
w(\alpha x) &= \lvert\alpha\rvert w(x) \\
w(x+y) &\leq w(x) + w(y)
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-norm}

 - Here $\lvert\alpha\rvert$ denotes the absolute value of the scalar $\alpha$.
 - Norms induce a distance metric on the vector space, $d (x, y) = w (x âˆ’ y)$, and vector space equipped with a norm (i.e. normed vector space) is therefore also a metric space.
 - Not all metric spaces are normed vector spaces. That is, there exist metric spaces that are not normed vector spaces.
 - A metric can define an _induced norm_ $w$ over a vector space (via $w(x) = d(x,0)$) if it satisfies the following:
$$
\begin{aligned}
d(w,v) &= d(u+w, u+v) \\
d(\alpha u,\alpha v) &= \lvert\alpha\rvert d(u,v)
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-inducednorm}

## Inner product space {#sec-innerproductspace}

An inner product space is a vector space $V$ over the field $F$ equipped with an inner product. An inner product is a map $\langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle :V \times V \to F$, that satisfies the properties for all vectors $x,y,z\in V$ and all scalars $a,b \in F$. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\langle x,y\rangle &={\overline {\langle y,x\rangle }} \\
\langle ax+by,z\rangle &=a \langle x,z\rangle +b\langle y,z\rangle \\
\langle x,x\rangle &\geq 0 \\
\langle x,x\rangle = 0 &\iff x = 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-innerproduct}

 - Conjugate symmetry implies $\langle x,x\rangle \in \mathbb{R}$. 
 - In many applications, $F$ is $\mathbb{R}$, and conjugate symmetry reduces to symmetry.
 - Every inner product space induces a norm, called its _canonical norm_: 
 $$\|x\|={\sqrt {\langle x,x\rangle }}$$


::: {.column-margin}
$p$-norm (or $L_p$-norm) is defined over a vector space as:
$$
\| x \| = \sqrt[p]{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^p}
$$

The distance induced by the $p$-norm is also known as the Minkowski distance of order $p$.

### Euclidean space {#sec-euc_manifold}

An $n$-dimensional Euclidean space is a particular metric space. In fact, it is a vector space equipped with an inner product. Vectors in Euclidean space are denoted as $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$. 

 - The inner product for two vectors $x$ and $y$ is defined as $\langle x, y \rangle = x \cdot y$, where $x \cdot y = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i$.
 - The inner product induces a norm (also known as 2-norm, following the definition of the more general case of $p$-norm) $\| x \| = \sqrt{x \cdot x}$.
 - The norm induces a distance metric: $d_{\textrm{euclidean}}(x,y) = \| x - y \|_2$. 

We often assume we are working with a Euclidean metric space $(\mathbb{R}^n, d_{\textrm{euclidean}})$ without explicitly stating definitions. However, considering these definitions make it easier to understand the more general case of a Riemannian manifold.

## Reimannian Manifold

Textbooks on differential geometry, e.g. @andrews2020dg would provide a more formal entry point and description for Manifolds. I'd like to point out connections here to Euclidean geometry to build some intuition first. In geometry taught in school, Euclidean geometry is introduced through its [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry). In particular, relaxing the fifth postulate (also referred at as the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate)) leads to ideas of spherical and hyperbolic geometry, which can also be viewed as special cases of Reimannian manifolds that have constant, _global curvature_.

Riemannian manifolds allow for _local curvature_. This local curvature is allowed to vary smoothly from one position to the next along the manifold. The local region around each position can be treated as a Euclidean space (we'll introduce the notion of tangent space for this). We can choose a coordinate system locally to account for the local curvature, and then keep using intuitions for Euclidean spaces there.

However, as we move along manifold, we'd like to modify the co-ordinate system itself to account for the local curvature. Because we are working with a smoothly varying curvature, we can do this using smooth transformations of the co-ordinate system - for which we use tools from calculus.

(To be continued ...)
