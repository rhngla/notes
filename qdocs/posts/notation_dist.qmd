Continuous probability distributions are commonly specified through the probability density function $p(x)$. A distribution with parameters $\theta$ can be viewed as a conditional distribution $p(x|\theta)$. In particular, the following notation is interchangeably used in the literature:
$$p_\theta(x) \equiv p(x;\theta) \equiv p(x|\theta)$$

Any subtlety in terms of whether the notation choice depends on whether $\theta$ is a parameter (i.e. a constant without a prior distribution associated with it), or is a random variable is up to the author to clarify and use consistently. See community discussions @faisse2014notation, @learner2011notation, and @bartlett2015paramrv.

At times, authors also drop the dependence on $\theta$ and simply write $p_{\theta}(x)$ as $p(x)$. This can be a source of a lot of confusion, and both authors and readers should be careful to prevent misundertanding.
