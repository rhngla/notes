## Change of variables theorem {#sec-change-of-variables}

Consider differentiable functions $f$ and $g$, where $g$ is assumed to be one-to-one (injective) on the interval $[a,b]$. If we consider the change of variable $x~\rightarrow~g(x)$, the following relationship holds:
$$
\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)}{f(x)dx} = \int_a^b{f(g(x))\frac{dg(x)}{dx}dx}
$${#eq-change-of-one-var}

The generalization of this relationship for the multi-variable case considers the integral over a region $\mathbf{x}~\in~X~\subseteq~\mathbb{R}^n$. This requires 

1. $g:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ to be injective over $X$, and
2. the Jacobian $J_g$ to be non-singular everywhere. 

The change of variables $x~\rightarrow~g(\mathbf{x})$ leads to the following equality:

$$
\int_{g(X)}{f(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}} = \int_{X}{f(g(\mathbf{x}))|\det(J_g(\mathbf{x}))|d\mathbf{x}}
$${#eq-change-of-variables}

::: {.column-margin}
Consider $g(\mathbf{x}) = (g_1(\mathbf{x}), ..., g_n(\mathbf{x}))$. The Jacobian 
matrix $J_g$ of function $g$ evaluated at $\mathbf{x}$:
$$
J_g = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
            \frac{\partial g_1(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial g_1(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x_n} \\
            \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
            \frac{\partial g_n(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial g_n(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x_n}
            \end{array}\right]
$$

## Invertible transformations

So far, we've only attempted to change our co-ordinate system in one direction, i.e. by transforming the coordinates with $g$. There are cases we may be interested in reversing the transformation. If $g$ were bijective, we'd have a well-defined $g^{-1}$ that would enable such a reverse transformation.

### A side note on Jacobians
One can think of the Jacobian $J_g$ as the operator that takes changes in the original co-oridinate system and provides the linear approximation of those changes in the new co-ordinate system.

$$
g(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{\epsilon}) = g(\mathbf{x}) + J_g(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{\epsilon}
$$

If we were to apply the coordinate transform and reverse it using the Jacobians, we can see that:

$$J^{-1}_g = J_{g^{-1}}$$

::: {.proof}
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{\epsilon} &= g^{-1}(g(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{\epsilon})) \\
&= g^{-1}(g(\mathbf{x})) + J_{g^{-1}}J_g(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{\epsilon} \\
&= \mathbf{x} + J_{g^{-1}}J_g(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{\epsilon} \\
\implies J_{g^{-1}}J_g &= I\ \forall\ \mathbf{x}
\end{aligned}
$$
Since the inverse is unique, we arrive at the relationship $J^{-1}_g = J_{g^{-1}}$.

### Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse

Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. 

1. Pseudoinverse $A^{+} := (A^T A)^{-1} A^T$
2. $A^{+} A = I$
3. $A A^{+} = I$
4. $(A^{+})^{+} = A$
5. If $A$ is square, then $A^{+} = A^{-1}$

The pseudoinverse exists and is unique.


## Applications to dimensionality reduction

## Applications to Normalizing flows

The goal is to learn an invertible transformation to map one probability distribution to another. We would like to construct a family of transformations that are guaranteed to be invertible, yet expressive enough to permit complex mappings. Here I'll discuss a clever idea in @dinh2016density that achieves this successfully.

There are two parts to their approach
1. Specify a family of invertible transformations
2. Ensure that determinant of the Jacobian for these transformations is computationally inexpensive to compute.

Their transformation enables the inverse transformation to be analytically specified. The Jacobian of their transformation is guaranteed to be lower triangular; noting that the determinant of a lower triangular matrix is the product of diagonal entries, the determinant of the Jacobian is also computationally inexpensive to compute.

The authors construct the transformation such that

1. The Jacobian is lower triangular
2. Therefore the determinant can be calculated as the product of all diagonal entries
3. The inverse transformation can be calculated analytically
