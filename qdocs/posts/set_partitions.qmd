The set cover problem refers to finding `K` non-empty subsets $s_1,...,s_K$, where each set $s_i$ consists of elements from a universe $U$, such that $\bigcup_i s_i = U$ and $|s_i| \geq 1$.

The number of feasible solutions to the set cover problem is given by the [Stirling number of the second kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_numbers_of_the_second_kind), denoted by $S(n, k)$, which describes the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ elements into $k$ non-empty subsets.



Choose $k$ elements from $n$ elements and fix the order

This can be done in $\binom{n}{k} \times k!$ ways

Then partition the remaining $n-k$ elements into $k$ subsets.

This can be done in $S(n-k, k)$ ways, where $S(n, k)$ is the Stirling number of the second kind.
